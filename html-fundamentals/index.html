          <h2>Cherry Trees in Blossom</h2>
        </header>
        <p>The cherry trees in George Street are covered in blossom.  Their dainty pink petals float down on the 'gentle' breeze, decorating the parked cars.  On some days it is more like a howling gale - it is Palmerston North afterall - but I prefer to forget those dreadful Spring days.  I remember the ones when the sun shines brightly with just a touch of warmth promising that Winter is on the way out.</p>
        <p>
        Shoppers dash in out of the little gift shops.  Those with a little more time enjoy a coffee with their friends.

          <h2>The Little Green Mini</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Most days, a little green mini is parked under the same tree. What a beauty!
        I wonder why the traffic warden's have not decended on it?  Surely it has stayed too long?</p>
        <p>Ah, now I see why.  This little car is parked so that the infamous 'frog' in the middle of the parking place is not covered. None of the wardens are even aware that it is there.  How crafty!</p>
